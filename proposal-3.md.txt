# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Ultimate Frisbee Pong 

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

We will use the pong format but set it up in a way that makes it appear as if two people are throwing a frisbee back and forth on a field.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?
We would like to take the basic framework for pong and turn it into a ulitmate frisbee game because all of us in this group play ultimte frisbee for temple. We would like to take the pong paddles and turn them into too two frisbee players who would 
be throwing the frisbee back and forth. We would like to potentially add defenders that pop up in the middle of the field to intercept the frisbee. For every 8 completions you get a point and the frisbee moves faster over time along with
more defenders. We also would change the background to a field and maybe add some other features. 


## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Benjamin Kamide, tuj37698@temple.edu, 
Vince DeHoratus, tul20274@temple.edu, Nichols

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?
We are able to change the sprites to frisbee sprites. 
We make it look like a field. 



### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

We add defenders to the game 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?
Really we just want it to work smoothly while causing the least amount of stress. :) 

Seriously we hope that we  
We could add animations for scoring goals.
## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

So our first steps will be to get the basic framework for pong and to brainstorm more ideas for the game. We will need to aquire some new coding knowledge to be able to make the defenders appear and score points. We will also need to know
how to change the sprites to frisbee players. Within our group we will split up the work to differnet parts of the game like finidng out how to change the sprites and how to add certain elements to the game. We also have been meeting
up as we are in the same bubble to also work out how we are going to finish the project.
